<!-- This is a place for product-specific config values. The format and
     filtering rules are the same as those in carrier_config*.xml, vendor.xml,
     and platform.xml files. This file is read after any specific config file
     from the assets folder, vendor.xml, and platform.xml so it must use
     explicit filters for MCC and MNC if that is desired. -->
